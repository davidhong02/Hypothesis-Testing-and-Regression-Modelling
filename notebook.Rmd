## Introduction  
This project aims to perform inferential statistics, especially conducting hypothesis testing and regression modelling on a given specific problem. This project consists of 3 different cases: hypothesis testing on carbon steels’ modulus of elasticity, hypothesis testing on mixtures’ resistance value, and regression modelling in airfoil performance.
